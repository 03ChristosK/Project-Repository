# Causal Inference Project: Evaluating the Lalonde Dataset

This repository contains the code and analysis for my independent research project on causal inference methods, completed as part of my undergraduate studies in Economic Theory & Econometrics.

---

## 1. Project Objective

The goal of this project is to estimate the causal effect of a job training program on real earnings. The analysis uses the well-known Lalonde (1986) dataset, which contains both experimental and non-experimental data, making it ideal for comparing different econometric techniques designed to handle selection bias.

## 2. Dataset

The project uses the `lalonde_data.csv` dataset, which contains information on individuals' earnings, education, age, and their participation in the job training program.

## 3. Methodology

This project moves beyond a simple OLS regression to provide a more robust estimate of the treatment effect. The analytical workflow is as follows:

* **Baseline Model:** A naive OLS regression is performed to establish a baseline estimate, highlighting the problem of selection bias.
* **Selection Model:** A Logit model is used to analyze the determinants of program participation.
* **Primary Estimator:** A **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** estimation using **Panel Data** with **Fixed Effects** is implemented to control for unobserved time-invariant characteristics.
* **Analysis of Assumptions:** The properties of the error terms from the models are processed and analyzed to test for issues like heteroskedasticity.
* **Critical Evaluation:** The final report points out the strengths and weaknesses of each analytical approach and the limitations of the data itself.

## 4. Key Skills Demonstrated

* **Econometric Modeling:** OLS, Logit, Panel Data (Fixed Effects), Difference-in-Differences.
* **Causal Inference:** Deep understanding of selection bias and methods to mitigate it.
* **Programming in Python:** Data manipulation with `pandas`, statistical modeling with `statsmodels`, and data visualization with `matplotlib`/`seaborn`.
